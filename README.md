# AI Bot Project

## Overview

This project is an AI bot that interacts with users and provides responses based on the input text. This is the initial version of the bot, and future improvements will be made to enhance its capabilities.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a `.env` File

To configure the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file should include your Gemini access key. 

Create a file named `.env` and add the following line:

```plaintext
GEMINI_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

Replace `your_access_key_here` with your actual Gemini access key.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary libraries and dependencies for the project.

## Running the Project

After setting up the `.env` file and installing the dependencies, you can run the project by executing the appropriate script or command as per the project's instructions.
